## Project Requirements
    * You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
    * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
    * Use at least two server-side APIs.
    * Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
    * Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
    * Be responsive.
    * Have a polished UI.
    * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
    * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
